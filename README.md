## Design Rationale
The library aims to make logging significantly easier for the application developer while at the same time reduce the overhead of logging in the critical path as much as possible.

The main goals of the library are:

- **Simplicity** A small example code snippet should be enough to get started and use most of features.
- **Performance** Ultra low latency for the caller threads, no string formatting on the hot path, no heap allocations after initialisation, asynchronous only mode.
- **Convenience** While super fast on the fast-path, the library aims to assist the devloper debugging the applicaation by providing textual output and ordered by timestamp log records.

## Features
 * Python style formatting by the excellent [{fmt}](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) library
 * Build in support for printing STL containers, std::pair, std::tuple, std::chrono and C++ classes with overloaded operator<<
 * Thread and Type safe with compile time checks
 * Configurable
 * Custom log patterns. Log statements can be formatted by providing a simple pattern
 * Log levels can be stripped out at compile time in release builds
 * Log records are written in timestamp order even if they were created by different threads
 * Various log targets (Handlers)
   * Console logging 
   * Rotating log files [Work in progress]
   * Daily log files [Work in progress]
    
## Integration

### CMake

#### External

To use this library from a CMake project, you can locate it directly with `find_package()` and use the namespaced imported target from the generated package configuration:

```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt
find_package(quill 3.2.0 REQUIRED)
...
add_library(foo ...)
...
target_link_libraries(foo PRIVATE quill::quill)
```

#### Embedded

To embed the library directly into an existing CMake project, place the entire source tree in a subdirectory and call `add_subdirectory()` in your `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(quill)
...
add_library(foo ...)
...
target_link_libraries(foo PRIVATE quill::quill)
```

### Package Managers

## Basic usage

```c++
#include "quill/Quill.h"

int main()
{
  // Start the logging backend thread
  quill::start();
  
  // Get a pointer to the default logger
  quill::Logger* dl = quill::get_logger();

  LOG_INFO(dl, "Welcome to Quill!");
  LOG_ERROR(dl, "An error message with error code {}, error message {}", 123, "system_error");

  LOG_WARNING(dl, "Support for int: {0:d};  hex: {0:x};  oct: {0:o}; bin: {0:b}", 42);
  LOG_CRITICAL(dl, "Easy padding in numbers like {:08d}", 12);

  LOG_DEBUG(dl, "This message and any message below this log level will not be displayed..");

  // Enable additional log levels on this logger
  dl->set_log_level(quill::LogLevel::TraceL3);

  LOG_DEBUG(dl, "The answer is {}", 1337);
  LOG_TRACE_L1(dl, "{:>30}", "right aligned");
  LOG_TRACE_L2(dl, "Positional arguments are {1} {0} ", "too", "supported");
  LOG_TRACE_L3(dl, "Support for floats {:03.2f}", 1.23456);
}
```

### Output
By default Quill outputs to stdout using the default formatting pattern:

`ascii_time [thread_id] filename:line log_level logger_name - message`
